Current Project: ML Reversi/Othello

My friend always beats me at Othello so I am going to make something she can't beat.  I'm going to use a variety of algorithms and then try and rank them on an elo scale.  Some of the algorithms are going to be a bit silly and others more serious.  I think it will be interesting to see which ones come out on top.  

If I have time I will add a visual component to it but for now it will just run in the console.
I am writing this in C++ so I can teach myself openGL when I add the visual component.
