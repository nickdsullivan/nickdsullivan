Current Project: Wave Form Collapse.

I will be working on a modified version of the terrain generation method Wave Form Collapse. Instead of strictly lowering possibilities with every tile placed I think some placements should add new possibilities ie(pyramids can only go in the middle of the desert so only if all tiles in x direction are desert can a pyramid be placed). Or only if the world is big enough can it have mountains or an ocean.

The main idea of Wave Form Collapse is to lower some tiles likely hood to zero (thus increase all of rest of the tiles by a fixed amount). The increase in likelyhood should be unevenly distributed even allowing previously 0% tiles to now have a chance (ie pyramid or oasis's jungle in the desert). And waves should propagate further than 1 tile away.
